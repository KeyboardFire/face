face stands for "fairly awful c-based esolang".  In the true style of C,
everything is a pointer and you have to allocate your own memory.

Code is parsed linearly, and each function has fixed arity.  When a function is
encountered, the next n bytes are treated as variables (variable names can be
any printable ASCII) and passed to the function.

The unary operators !~ and binary operators +-*/%&|^<> are supported, and they
do the same thing they do in C.  In addition, = corresponds to C's ==.  They
take one more argument than they traditionally do in C; for example, +abc
roughly corresponds to
  *a = *b + *c
in C, and similarly !de is used for
  *d = !*e
The % operator is patched to use the fmod* family of functions for floats.

At every point in a face program, a global "number mode" exists that dictates
how variables are dereferenced.  This defaults to signed integer (the int type
in C).  In this mode, +abc is really interpreted as
  *(int*)a = *(int*)b + *(int*)c
as internally all variables are stored as void*.  However, if the number mode
is set to, say, unsigned long, then the same face code +abc is interpreted as
  *(unsigned long*)a = *(unsigned long*)b + *(unsigned long*)c
The number mode can be changed with the , command followed by a letter, which
can be one of the following:
  c  char
  s  short
  i  int
  l  long
  m  long long
  f  float
  d  double
  e  long double
Lowercase letters are used for signed types, and uppercase for unsigned.  (Both
work for floats and doubles, but there is no functional difference.)

There is another quasi-number-mode, pointer mode (p).  This mode only exists to
work with pointers to pointers, such as that returned by the Av (argv) command.
DO NOT use any operators, make any assignments, or execute any command that
involves the value of a variable while in pointer mode!  Bad Things will
happen, as the only defined operations while in pointer mode are malloc and
friends and the pointer manipulation commands $'`"_ (described below).

Flow control in face is done entirely via jumps.  Labels are indicated with :x
where x can be any ASCII character, and jumps can be unconditional or
conditional.  An unconditional jump (corresponds to goto in C) is done with .x
and a conditional jump with ?cx (c is the condition, and the jump will be
executed iff its dereferenced value is not zero).

face supports a primitive form of self-modification or introspection.  The \
command takes two arguments and assigns a pointer to the beginning of the
source code to the first and a pointer to the instruction pointer to the
second.  The instruction pointer is, in fact, not a pointer, but simply an
integer representing the index in the source code of the command being
evaluated.  \ can be used to access strings stored in the source code, which
can be skipped by either jumps or by modifying the instruction pointer.

Amusingly, the \ command is effectively required for any nontrivial program!
This is true because malloc and calloc require an argument specifying how much
memory to allocate, but all arguments are passed as pointers in face, running
into a sort of circular logic.  However, one can use the values of the pointers
returned from the \ command as arguments to malloc to circumvent this issue.

To facilitate the use of \ to access embedded strings, all @ characters are
replaced with null bytes in a preprocessing stage.  In order to allow the use
of actual @ characters, the # symbol acts as an escape character (so, #@ is a
literal @, and ## is a literal #).  Additionally, # followed by an uppercase
letter or ?[\]^ is converted to its corresponding unprintable character by
XORing with 0x40, a la caret notation.

The only proper "assignment" operators (aside from pointer assignment) are the
digits 0 through 9.  These act as unary functions that take a pointer as an
argument; for example, 6a corresponds to the C code *a = 6.  Pointer assignment
is binary and uses the $ operator; e.g. $ab assigns the pointer value of b to a
(a = b in C, where a and b are pointers).

There are also four other pointer manipulation commands.  The ' command
increments a pointer ('a is a++) and the ` command decrements a pointer (`a is
a--).  The " command shifts a pointer by a given amount ("ab is a += *b); note
that the second argument is always dereferenced as a signed integer regardless
of number mode!  Finally, the unary _ command "rewinds" or resets a pointer to
its original value; that is, the value it had before any '`" operations were
performed on it.

Comments are expressed with the notation ( ... ) -- that is, when a ( symbol is
encountered in parsing, everything until the following ) is ignored.
Additionally, if a q is encountered as a command while parsing, the program is
immediately terminated.

Lowercase letters typically represent standard library functions.  The
following are currently available:

  c   a = calloc((size_t)*b, sizeof nummode)
  e   a = stderr
  i   a = stdin
  m   a = malloc((size_t)*b * sizeof nummode)
  o   a = stdout
  p   *a = sprintf(b, c, ...)
  r   *a = fread(b, 1, (size_t)*c, d)
  s   *a = sscanf(b, c, ...)
  w   *a = fwrite(b, 1, (size_t)*c, d)

As a special case, the m function will call realloc if its first argument is
the last reference to a given pointer (and c will call free in the same case),
thus eliminating the need to manually free memory.  The commands @, \, and p
also have this auto-freeing behavior.  (Consider this the one concession to
usability that face provides.)

Variadic functions are called by specifying a type (cCsSiIlLmMfFdDeEpP, where p
is any pointer) followed by a variable name any number of times.  The argument
list is terminated when the following character is not part of this set.  For
example, n = sprintf(s, "%d %f\n", x, y) would roughly translate to pns%ixdy,
assuming the format string is stored in %.

Also note that the p/sprintf function has special behavior that automatically
allocates the right amount of memory for the string being printed into, making
it somewhat like the nonstandard GNU asprintf().

Uppercase letters are typically collections of related functions:

  Ac   *a = argc
  Av   a = argv

  M(   *a = ceil(*b)
  MC   *a = acos(*b)
  MM   *a = max(*b, *c);
  MS   *a = asin(*b)
  MT   *a = atan(*b)
  M^   *a = pow(*b * *c)
  Ma   *a = abs(*b)
  Mc   *a = cos(*b)
  Me   *a = exp(*b)
  Mf   *a = floor(*b)
  Ml   *a = log(*b)
  Mm   *a = min(*b, *c);
  Mp   *a = M_PI
  Mr   *a = round(*b)
  Ms   *a = sin(*b)
  Mt   *a = tan(*b)

  Rm   *a = RAND_MAX
  Rr   *a = rand()
  Rs   srand(*a)

  Sc   *a = strcmp(b, c)
  Sl   *a = strlen(b)

The math functions that have X, Xf, and Xl variants use the appropriate one in
floating point nummodes and fallback to the X (double) version otherwise.  The
abs function uses the appropriate function from abs, labs, llabs, fabs, fabsf,
and fabsl, falling back to abs for chars and shorts.  max and min use the
appropriate fmax/fmin function for floats and a custom implementation for ints.
