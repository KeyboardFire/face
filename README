face - fairly awful c-based esolang

Sample code (prints "Hello, World!" with trailing newline):

    (Hello, World!
    )\$*m#*7#+###,c'$,ioow#$#o

The motivation for the creation of face was that I wanted an esolang that makes
you allocate your own memory.  (The reasons for this desire should be
self-evident.)

For an introduction to face, see doc/face.txt.  To compile, simply run make.
face depends on libffi.

face is licensed under the GPL 3.0.
